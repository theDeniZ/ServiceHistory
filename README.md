# BMW Service Manager App. 
Allows creation and managing of the BMW Service History. 

Tested on NBT ECU only. May or may not work on CIC / NBT Evo.

## Create and manage the history file

The Service History is a file with a *.tst extension (also a `Ediabas Toolset 32` Test file). You can load an existing one or create a new file.

Use the Web App for this purpouse.

## Write history to a car

In order to write created history with this application, you will need installed EDIABAS library. No other app is required, the "BMW Standart Tools" is sufficient. The connection to the car should be configured and working. It is required to have a connection to the car, while using this application.
The Ediabas should also be configured to have all needed ECU group / SGBD files. We will need at least **g_mmi.grp** and **nbt.prg** files.

Complete following steps to successfully write the history to the car:
- Connect the PC to the Car wia some preffered connection (DCan/ICOM/â€¦) and setup the connection wia the Ediabas if needed (Set Com port / reserve ICOM / update Ediabas.ini)
- Open the **Ediabas Toolset 32** application (standard Ediabas tools app).
- In menu File -> Load SGBD, Group file and select the **g_mmi.grp** file in the directory where you placed it beforehand (usually C:/Ediabas/Ecu)
- In menu File -> Load Test and select the Service History file, created with the Service Manager Application. You will find a new window opened with the test shown. The content is read from the file and is wery similar to it. See the chapter "File parsing"
- In menu Test -> Run test. The commands will begin sending to the car. This may require a few minutes
- Done

Any errors in the Ediabas Toolset 32 are Ediabas errors, which you may resolve by searching the internet. 

## File Parsing

If you have a Service History file, created with this app, you may find that the content of this file looks like this:

`1|g_mmi|steuern_servicehistory_erase
2|g_mmi|steuern_servicehistory_add||8;11;2020;0;175021;0;03181;0x1;5;1;0x1;0;0;4;0x1;0;0;11;0x1;0;0;12;0x1;0;0;100;0x1;0;0
3|g_mmi|steuern_servicehistory_add||8;3;2019;0;151690;0;03181;0x1;2;1;0x1;0;0;4;0x1;0;0
4|g_mmi|steuern_servicehistory_add||3;2;2019;0;130024;0;00383;0x1;1;3;0x1;0;0
`

Each line of this file corresponds to a command, sent to a car. Each line contains the `|` symbol, separating the parts of a request.
As you can see, each command uses "g_mmi" group file and some functions of it: "steuern_servicehistory_erase" and "steuern_servicehistory_add" which correspond to erasing the history and adding a new entry.

The next parameters contain all required information: date, milage, dealer, bmw flag and all services.
